sAbout This Project
Women Safety and Security Mobile Website is important at this time. The users need to register themselves on the app by creating their own accounts. This app service shall be a one-time registration, the users are required to fill in their basic details at the time of registration. After making an account users would be qualified to use all the services intended to protect and empower them. Services include an automated distress SOS to the nearest police station and to her emergency contacts, not only this the app will also automatically send distress signals to nearby people within a specified radius with a live location. The user can also lodge an FIR against the alleged person which shall be geotagged on the digital map and timestamped. We also look forward to ensuring the safety of women in public transport, we propose that every public transport a bus, cab, or auto rickshaw shall be fitted with a GPS device which will be monitored by the police at all times. The GPS monitoring shall be locally distributed among the police and their mobile patrolling units i.e., they will be monitoring only over a certain area that is within their reach depending upon their standing location. safety of Women is a very important issue due to the rising crimes against women these days. To help resolve this issue we propose a GPS-based women safety system that has dual security features. This device consists of a system that ensures dual alerts in case a woman is harassed or thinks she is in trouble. This system can be turned on by a woman in case she even thinks she would be in trouble. It is useful because once an incident occurs with a woman she may or may not get the chance to press the emergency button. In a button-press alerting system, in case a woman is hit on the head from behind, she may never get the chance to press the panic button and no one will know she is in trouble. this is a fully secure application.
